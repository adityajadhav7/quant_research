Edward O. Thorp	American mathematics professor, author, hedge fund manager, and blackjack researcher		
	He also developed and applied effective hedge fund techniques in the financial markets

	He learned Fortran in order to program the equations needed for his theoretical research model on the probabilities of winning at blackjack. Thorp analyzed the game of blackjack to a great extent this way, while devising card counting schemes with the aid of the IBM 704 in order to improve his odds especially near the end of a card deck that is not being reshuffled after every deal.		
	Thorp's first hedge fund was Princeton/Newport Partners from 1969 to 1989 based on Market Neutral Derivatives Hedging. His second hedge fund was called Ridgeline Partners and it ran from August 1994 through September 2002 based on statistical arbitrage.

Steven Cohen	Cohen is known for his contrarian approach to investing, which involves taking positions opposite to prevailing market sentiment. He isn't afraid to go against the crowd and capitalize on mispricings or market inefficiencies.		
	He places a strong emphasis on identifying undervalued stocks and capitalizing on market inefficiencies.		
	Cohen is renowned for his ability to adapt swiftly to changing market conditions. During the late 1990s dot-com bubble, his portfolio surged by an impressive 70%, and he astutely shorted the same stocks when the tech bubble burst in 2000, generating another 70% return. This agility and responsiveness to market shifts have been instrumental in his success.		
	The top sectors in Steve Cohen's stock portfolio include technology, healthcare, consumer discretionary, and industrials		
	Steve Cohen believes in maintaining a well-diversified portfolio spanning various sectors and companies. He actively monitors and adjusts his positions based on market conditions and company performance.
